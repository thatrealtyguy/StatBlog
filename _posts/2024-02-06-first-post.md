<p class="intro"><span class="dropcap">W</span>elcome to my blog! I am creating this as a part of a project with Stat 386 at BYU. I am considering continuing this after this class because it actually seems pretty cool!</p>

### Why I want to continue this blog.  

1. This is a good way for me to post updates on projects and include this website as a part of my resume to make it look really cool!  

2. I feel like this could be a cool fun side project that will continue to be something I can work on and make look even cooler over time!

3. This is the spiritual successor to my website I made for an old CS class: clubpenguin.link
